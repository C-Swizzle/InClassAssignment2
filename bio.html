        On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled 
        and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot
         foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail
          in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil
           and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our 
           power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like
            best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances 
            and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that
             pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds
              in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater
               pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.
